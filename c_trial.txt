1. SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
2. Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black
3. COUNTESS
4. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
5. BERTRAM
6. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
7. anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
8. whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
9. LAFEU
10. You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
11. sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
12. good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
13. worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
14. than lack it where there is such abundance.
15. COUNTESS
16. What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
17. LAFEU
18. He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
19. practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
20. finds no other advantage in the process but only the
21. losing of hope by time.
22. COUNTESS
23. This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
24. 'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
25. almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
26. far, would have made nature immortal, and death
27. should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
28. king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
29. the death of the king's disease.
30. LAFEU
31. How called you the man you speak of, madam?
32. COUNTESS
33. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
34. his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
35. LAFEU
36. He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
37. lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
38. was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
39. could be set up against mortality.
40. BERTRAM
41. What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
42. LAFEU
43. A fistula, my lord.
44. BERTRAM
45. I heard not of it before.
46. LAFEU
47. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
48. the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
49. COUNTESS
50. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
51. overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
52. her education promises; her dispositions she
53. inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
54. an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
55. commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
56. traitors too; in her they are the better for their
57. simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
58. LAFEU
59. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
60. COUNTESS
61. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
62. in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
63. her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
64. livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
65. go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
66. a sorrow than have it.
67. HELENA
68. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
69. LAFEU
70. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
71. excessive grief the enemy to the living.
72. COUNTESS
73. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
74. makes it soon mortal.
75. BERTRAM
76. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
77. LAFEU
78. How understand we that?
79. COUNTESS
80. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
81. In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
82. Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
83. Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
84. Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
85. Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
86. Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
87. But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
88. That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
89. Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
90. 'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
91. Advise him.
92. LAFEU
93. He cannot want the best
94. That shall attend his love.
95. COUNTESS
96. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.
97. Exit
98. BERTRAM
99. [To HELENA] The best wishes that can be forged in
100. your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
101. to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.
102. LAFEU
103. Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
104. your father.
105. Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
106. HELENA
107. O, were that all! I think not on my father;
108. And these great tears grace his remembrance more
109. Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
110. I have forgot him: my imagination
111. Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
112. I am undone: there is no living, none,
113. If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
114. That I should love a bright particular star
115. And think to wed it, he is so above me:
116. In his bright radiance and collateral light
117. Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
118. The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
119. The hind that would be mated by the lion
120. Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
121. To see him every hour; to sit and draw
122. His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
123. In our heart's table; heart too capable
124. Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
125. But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
126. Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
127. Enter PAROLLES
128. Aside
129. One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
130. And yet I know him a notorious liar,
131. Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
132. Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
133. That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
134. Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
135. Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
136. PAROLLES
137. Save you, fair queen!
138. HELENA
139. And you, monarch!
140. PAROLLES
141. No.
142. HELENA
143. And no.
144. PAROLLES
145. Are you meditating on virginity?
146. HELENA
147. Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
148. ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
149. may we barricado it against him?
150. PAROLLES
151. Keep him out.
152. HELENA
153. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
154. in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
155. warlike resistance.
156. PAROLLES
157. There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
158. undermine you and blow you up.
159. HELENA
160. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
161. blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
162. virgins might blow up men?
163. PAROLLES
164. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
165. blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
166. the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
167. is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
168. preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
169. increase and there was never virgin got till
170. virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
171. metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
172. may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
173. ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!
174. HELENA
175. I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
176. PAROLLES
177. There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
178. rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
179. is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
180. disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
181. virginity murders itself and should be buried in
182. highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
183. offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
184. much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
185. paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
186. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
187. self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
188. canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
189. by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
190. itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
191. principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
192. HELENA
193. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
194. PAROLLES
195. Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
196. likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
197. lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
198. while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
199. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
200. of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
201. like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
202. now. Your date is better in your pie and your
203. porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
204. your old virginity, is like one of our French
205. withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
206. 'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
207. marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?
208. HELENA
209. Not my virginity yet [ ]
210. There shall your master have a thousand loves,
211. A mother and a mistress and a friend,
212. A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
213. A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
214. A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
215. His humble ambition, proud humility,
216. His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
217. His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
218. Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
219. That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
220. I know not what he shall. God send him well!
221. The court's a learning place, and he is one--
222. PAROLLES
223. What one, i' faith?
224. HELENA
225. That I wish well. 'Tis pity--
226. PAROLLES
227. What's pity?
228. HELENA
229. That wishing well had not a body in't,
230. Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
231. Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
232. Might with effects of them follow our friends,
233. And show what we alone must think, which never
234. Return us thanks.

237. Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.
238. Exit
239. PAROLLES
240. Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I
241. will think of thee at court.
242. HELENA
243. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
244. PAROLLES
245. Under Mars, I.
246. HELENA
247. I especially think, under Mars.
248. PAROLLES
249. Why under Mars?
250. HELENA
251. The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
252. be born under Mars.
253. PAROLLES
254. When he was predominant.
255. HELENA
256. When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
257. PAROLLES
258. Why think you so?
259. HELENA
260. You go so much backward when you fight.
261. PAROLLES
262. That's for advantage.
263. HELENA
264. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
265. but the composition that your valour and fear makes
266. in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.
267. PAROLLES
268. I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
269. acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the
270. which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
271. thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
272. counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
273. thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
274. thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
275. thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
276. none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,
277. and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.
278. Exit
279. HELENA
280. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
281. Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
282. Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
283. Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
284. What power is it which mounts my love so high,
285. That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
286. The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
287. To join like likes and kiss like native things.
288. Impossible be strange attempts to those
289. That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
290. What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
291. So show her merit, that did miss her love?
292. The king's disease--my project may deceive me,
293. But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.
